    <h1 class="title">Gender Equality</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">the 1960s was the start of the civi rights movement where women fought for a better life in American society. They succeeded and with the Civil rights act of 1964, discrimination in employment BASED on their gender is now prohibited. This says so much about society before, men were seen as the superior gender and women had limited rights. This is more severe in the more earlier years as women were not allowed to engage in education. Although many governments globally have already given women equal rights women are still treated badly by others who do not support this. Nobody deserves this kind of discrimination, everyone must be given equal rights.</p>
